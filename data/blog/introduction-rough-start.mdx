## An Introduction
Hi, I'm Fernando and I have a confession to make.

I looked back at old repositories from GitHub and GitLab, and see a bunch of baby projects I've worked on for community college seven years ago. One of these was a blog.

I've been programming since 2014, and to tell the truth I don't have anything to show for it but a bunch of flatlined, empty projects and templates.
