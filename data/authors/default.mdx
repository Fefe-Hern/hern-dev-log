From being a tech support to all my friends, to graphic design, to QA Analyst and Software Development,
I've spent day and night on learning topics that interest me. Cooking, software development, mathematics...

I've recently graduated Stony Brook University, and got a certification with BigCommerce for E-Commerce storefronts.

With me is Achilles, my rabbit.
